# LinRegressionGrades
This is my first small project of machine learning through the usage of linear regression
Uses sklearn's linear regression model https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html

Imports student data from a student-mat.csv and predicts the grades of a student based on 5 grades
In the return statement, the suspected grade is shown, followed by the data it used for the model in brackets
and the actual grade at the end
The actual grade vs predicted is used for the accuracy.
